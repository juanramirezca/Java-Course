01 Dates
There are three important classes in Java used for dates: LocalDate, LocalDateTime, LocalTime.
In order to use these classes we have to import them with the following instruction.
These classes are all immutable.

import java.time.*

1.1 LocalDate
We can create an instance of this class like:

LocalDate now = LocalDate.now()

There are multimple methods that we can use with this class, such as getYear, getDayOfMonth(), lengthOfYear(), lengthOfMonth(). 
Those methods provide a lot of metadata about the current date.


1.2 LocalDateTime
It represents both the date and the current time.

This class also has a lot of useful methods corresponding the date and time.


1.3 LocalTime
It just represents the time.
