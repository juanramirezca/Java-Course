A wrapper class encloses(wraps) around a data type and gives it an object appearance.
The wrapper classes are final and immutable.

Types:
* Wrapper: Boolean, Byte, Character, Double, Float, Integer, Long, Short.
* Primitive: boolean, byte, char, double, float, int, long, short.

The wrapper classes are useful because they provide us different methods.

1. Creation from other data types
Integer hundred = Integer.valueOf("100");
Boolean value = Boolean.valueOf("True");

There is also another way to create an instace of this class:
Integer i1 = new Integer(100);

The difference is that the valueOf method does not create another object if there exist one that has the same value.

2. Auto boxing
Uses the method valueOf() in the background to create an instace of a class.

Integer seven 7;
