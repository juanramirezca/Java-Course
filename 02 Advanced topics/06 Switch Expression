Switch expression allows us to create expressions using switch statement. 
It was released in JDK14.

Example

public class SwitchExpressionRunner {
	
	public static String findDayOfTheWeekWithSwitchExpression(int day){
		String dayOfWeek = switch(day){
			case 0 -> {
				//Complex logic here.
				yield "Sunday";
			}
			case 1 -> "Monday";
			case 2 -> "Tuesday";
			case 3 -> "Wednesday";
			case 4 -> "Thursday";
			default -> throw new IllegalArgumentException("Invalid Option" + day);
		};
		return dayOfWeek;
	}

	public static void main(String[] args){

	}
}

Notice that you have to use the keyword "yield" to return a value. Also is important that there is no fallthrough.
