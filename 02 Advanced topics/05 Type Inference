Type Inference is one of the new features of Java 10, where the compiler infers the type of the variable at compile time.

Example:
//List <String> numbers = new ArrayList<>(list);
var numbers = new ArrayList<>(list);

We can make it immutable using the final keyword. 

5.1 In loops
We can used it in a loop

Example:

for(var = 1; var <= 10; var++){
	//instruction
}

for(var num: numbers){
	//instruction
}

5.2 Null value
You cannot assign a null value to a var variable.

5.3 Var is NOT a keyword
Var is not a keyword, which means that you can use this word as a variable.
