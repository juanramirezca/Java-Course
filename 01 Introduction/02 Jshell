We can use jshell from the command prompt on Windows or on the terminal in Mac.

We just type: jshell to enter and /exit to exit the jshell.

Let's see some examples of simple computations:

5 + 3
7 - 1
5 * 5
5 / 2
9 % 2

n % 2 == 0 => par
n % 2 == 1 => impar


Exercise 1. Calculate number of minutes in a day. R = 1440
Exercise 2. Calculate number of hours in a week. R = 168
Exercise 3. Calculate the sum of the first 10 numbers (1 + 2 + 3 + ... + 10). R = 55
Exercise 4. Given a bill of $53.25 USD, obtain a tip of 15%.
Exercise 5. From the previous example, obtain the total to pay (bill + tip).
