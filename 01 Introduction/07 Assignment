In Java when we want to assign a value to a variable, we do something like this.

int x = 10;

Notice that is different that in maths. Because we are assigning or storing the value 10 to the variable x.

Now, suppose we want assign a new value to the variable x.

x = 15;

This means that x does not have the value of 10 anymore, and now the value is 15.

7.1 Increment and decrement
We can increment our value or decrement doing something like this

x = x + 1

And now the value of x will be 16.

Another ways of doing the same thing is the following.

x++
x += 1

Likewise, we can decrement with the following statements. For instace, if y = 3

y = y - 1
y--
y -= 1

The result of these three sentences will be the same: y = 2.

7.2 Coding debugging exercises
1. 
int x, y;
x = 7
y = x++

What are the values of y and x after this two lines of code?

2. 
int x, y;
x = 7
y = ++x
What are the values of y and x after this two lines of code?

3. 
int x, y;
x = 7
y += ++x
What are the values of y and x after this two lines of code?
