In Java to print, show or display information to the user, we can use the following instruction:

System.out.print("Hello, World"); System.out.print("Hello, World"); System.out.print("Hello, World");

For instance, if we want to display the solution of a computation like 3 * 4, we can do something like this: 

System.out.println("3 * 4");

"3 * 4"

As you can notice for the first example, in Java we use "Strings" to represent a sequence of characters and we MUST surround our characters with double quotes.

Exercises:
1. Show to the user the following: "Goodbye, World!"
2. Print the result of computing 8 * 5
3. Print the result of computing 8 + 2 * 5
4. Display the following string "8 * 5 = 40"
5. Print the following: "The result is: " and then the result of 8 * 5.

"7 * 9 = " ?
