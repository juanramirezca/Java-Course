We can use a variable to store values. And the way to declare a variable in Java is the following

<type of variable> <name of variable> = value.

int number = 10;

This process is called *declaration*

And we can change the value of the variable number.

number = 15;

And this is called *assignment*

Exercise. Create three integer variables called sc1, sc2, sc3 and then compute the mean of them.

6.1 Naming a Variable
* We can only use a combination of letters, numbers, $, and underscore(_)
* Cannot start with a number
* Cannot be a keyword (Int, System, etc.)
* Usually camelCase 
* Use a meaningful name for the variable

6.2 Variables types

* byte b = 5 -> 8 bits (1 byte)
* short s = 238 -> 16 bits (2 bytes) 
* int i = 4000 -> 32 bits (4 bytes)
* long l = 2222223 -> 64 bits (8 bytes)

All of these previous examples represent numbers without decimal part. Now, we will see types that can be used when we want to 
represent a number with decimal part.


* float f = 4.0f -> 32 bits (4 bytes), but not very precise.
* double d = 67.0 -> 64 bits (8 bytes)

BIG decimal

* char c = 'F' -> 16 bits
* boolean isTrue = false -> true or false

6.3 Exercises

1. Compute the area of a triangle of base 10 cm and height 15 cm. 

2. Compute the area of a circle of radius 5.
Area = Ï€ * r ^ 2

3. Compute the average of three scores: 8.5, 7.2, and 9.3

4. Given celsius degrees, convert from celsius to fahrenheit
Fahr = 9/5 * Celsius + 32

6.4 Homework
 1. A group of three friends go out to dinner and the bill to pay is $213.50 USD, if they decide to leave a tip of %15.
 a) How much will the tip be? tip = 26.23 USD
 b) How much will they need to pay in total (bill + tip)?
 c) How much should each of them pay?
 
 2. John's salary is $87,500 USD / year, and his employer told him we will receive a Christmas bonus of a month's salary.
