As we said in the previous module, we can use the following instruction to print out information:

System.out.println()

Now, we will see some extra features that we can use when printing.

If we would like to have two words in different lines, we can do something like this:

System.out.println("hello \n world")

Likewise, we can use a tab between words.

For instance: 
System.out.println("hello \t world") // tab o tabulador

Finally if we want to print special characters such as "" or \, we need to use an extra \

System.out.println("hello \\ world")

System.out.println("hello \" world")


hello \ world \ !

Exercises:
1. Print in two different lines "Goodbye World".
2. Print the following: "8 * 5 = 40" using a tabulator between the operation and the result.
3. Display to the user the famous quote of Rene Descartes: "Cogito, ergo sum".
