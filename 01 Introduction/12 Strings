In Java there is a class called String and we can have instances of that class.

For instance:

String str1 = "Test"

12.1 Useful functions
There are some useful functions in this class that can help us perform some specific tasks.

12.1.1 charAt()
This method returns the indice of a character within a String.

Examples:

str1.charAt(0);
str1.charAt(3);
str1.charAt(4);

12.1.2 substring()
This method returns a sub string of a given string.

String longString = "This is a long string"

Examples: 
longString.substring(5);
longString.substring(5,13);

12.1.3 length()
This method returns the total of characters that there are in a string.

longString.length();

12.1.4 indexOf()
Returns de index of a character within a string

str1.indexOf('T');
str1.indexOf('i');

12.1.5 contains()
This is a method that let us know if a substring is in a string. If it is in the strings returns true, otherwise returns false.

str1.contains("Te");

12.1.6 isEmpty()
The method returns true if a string is empty, otherwise returns false.

int str = "";
str1.isEmpty();
str.isEmpty();


12.1.7 equals()
A method that returns true if two strings are the same, otherwise it returns a false.

int newStr = " ";

newStr.equals(str);

12.2 Concatenation
There are two ways to concatenate strings in Java.
One is by using the '+' operator.
And the other is with the method concat()

Examples:
"1" + "2"

"2".concat("3")

12.3 More methods.
If we would like to see a list of all the methods that the class String have we can use the dot notation follow by the tab button.

Example.
String st = "";
st.<tab>

12.4 Jata String Alternatives
There are two classes alternatives to create strings in Java: StringBuffer and StringBuilder. We use them when we want multiple instances of a String.

12.4.1 StringBuffer
Another class used in Java to create String. The main difference is that StringBuffer is mutable, while the String class is immutable.
We use StringBuffer when we are talking about threading

Example
StringBuffer sb = new StringBuffer("Test");
sb.append(" #2")

12.4.2 StringBuilder
Another class used to create instances of a String. 

StringBuilder sb = new StringBuilder("test1");
