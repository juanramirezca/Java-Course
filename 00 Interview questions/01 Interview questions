Interview questions:

#1 Given a string, determine the unique characters of that string.
s = "Miguel Garza" ==> M, i, g, u, e, l, , G, a, r, z
s = asistencia ==> a, s, i, t, e, n, c

M
i
g
u
e
l
G
a
r
z


2. Is Unique: Implement an algorithm to determine if a string has all unique characters.
s = "Miguel Garza" => False
s1 = "murcielago" => True
s2 = "!#$%&/()=?¡abcdefghijklmnñopqrstuvwxyzABCDEF" => True









3. Implement a method to perform basic string compression using the counts of repeated characters.
Example.

aabcccccaaa would become a2b1c5a3.
