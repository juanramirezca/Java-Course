A setter is a way from other class to access to the data inside of the class.
And the way to do a setter is by using a method inside the class to access that data.

We have also to change the modifier status of the data to "private".

Example. 

public class Student {
	
	private String name;

	void setName(String name){
		this.name = name;

	}
}

Notice from the previous code that name is a local variable (usually passed by another class) and this.name refers to the class Student.



Public class Main {
 Psvm {
	Student Miguel = new Student();
	Miguel.setName("Miguel")
