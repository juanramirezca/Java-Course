02 Methods in Java

A method is an action or behaviour of a particular class.

The syntax of a method within a class looks like this.

class Planet{
	void revolve(){
		System.out.println("Revolve");
	}
}

To use the method of that class we have to create an object and then we can use the created method.

Planet earth = new Planet()

earth.revolve()
