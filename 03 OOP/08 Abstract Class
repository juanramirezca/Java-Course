Usually when we create a class, we provide the implementation of each method. In an Abstract class we do not  do this, that is we just leave the method declaration empty.

Example

abstract class AbstractAnimal {
	abstract public void bark();
}

Then, the sub-classes are the ones who implement the corresponding methods. 

class Dog extendes AbstractAnimal {
	public void bark(){
		System.out.println("Guau!")
	}
}

And now we can create an instance from the sub-class, but not from the abstract class. That means, we cannot create an instance of an abstract class.

Also an abstract class can extend from another abstract class. 

Exercise. Make a Figure Abstract class and then a Triangle and Square classes that extends from this figure class.
