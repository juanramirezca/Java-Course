A class is a template where we can create multiple instances called objects. 

Defines a data and contains methods, 
which perform actions in the class.

The syntax to create a class in Java is the following:

class Country {
	
}

And now we can create a instances of this class.

Country mexico = new Country()

Notice that now "mexico" is an object of the class
