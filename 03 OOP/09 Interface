We can think of an interface like a gaming control of a console, which has different buttons, and depending the game we are doing different things.

So, when we create an interface we are providing multiple implententations for the same thing.

To create an interface we have to define the following definition

public interface GamingControl {
	moveUp();
	moveDown();
	moveLeft();
	moveRight();
}

And we have to use the keyword implements to use an interface.

It is also a way to communicate with other projects through the interface.

Exercises.

1. Make a gaming control for mario bros and mario kart.

2. Create a complex algorithm and leave it to a collegue.
