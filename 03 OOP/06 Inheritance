We use inheritance when we have repeated code in two classes. 

For instance, suppose we have the class Person that has the following attributes: name, last name, and email. And now we create another class Student,
which has the exact same attributes and a couple of extra attributes.

The problem is that if we want to change an attribute, we would have to modify two classes. To address this problem, we can use inheritance.

When using *inheritance* we will have two classes:
1. Parent class(or super class)
2. Child class (or sub class).

To use inheritance, we can use the keyword extends in the child class

Example. 
public class Student extends Person {
	
}

In java there is NOT multiple inheritance.
