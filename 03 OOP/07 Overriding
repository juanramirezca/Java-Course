This concepts is too related with inheritance because we can use a method from the super class and modify it.

That is, if we have a method in the super class, we can use the same method but with different parameters and different result.

Example. 
We can modify the toString method of the Object class. 

public String toString(){
	statement
}

Exercise. Create an Employee class that inherits from the Person class.
Employee will have the following extra attributes: job_position, employer, salary; also it should have the toString() method with all the values.

With the method super we can use the  attributes from the super class.
