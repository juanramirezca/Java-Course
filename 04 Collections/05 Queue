The queue is used when we have to process some information in the order is presented to us. For instance a to-do list.

Let's see an example of a queue.

Queue<String> queue = new PriorityQueue<>();

5.1 poll()
This method is used to get elements from the queue.

queue.poll();

5.2 offer()
This method is used to insert an element to the queue.

queue.offer("apple");

5.3 addAll()
We can use this method when we want to insert many elements to the queue.

queue.addAll(List.of("Zebra", "Monkey", "Papagayo"));
