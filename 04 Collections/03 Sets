In a set collection, we cannot have duplicate elements. Also there is not positional access in sets.

Let's see an example of how we can create an immutable set in Java.

Set<String> set = Set.of("Apple", "Banana", "Cantaloupe")

If we would like to modify the elements we have three different options.

3.1 Hashset
When using a hashset there is no order neither in the way we insert the elements, or in relation with the other elements.

Set <String> hashset = new HashSet<>(set)

hashset.add("Dog");

3.2 LinkedHashSet
When we use this data structure, we have an order according to the way we insert the elements.


3.3 TreeSet
When using a TreeSet, the elements are stored in a sorted way.
