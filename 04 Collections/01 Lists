List

In a list we have the control of the position of every element: when adding a new element or deleting one.

A easy way to create a list is with the static method call of. For instance, we can create a List of strings like this.

List <String> words = List.of("Apple", "Bat", "Cat");

1.1 Useful methods in a List
There are many methods that we can use in a list, and we will see some of the most useful 

1.1.1 The size() method
We can use the size method to know the length of the list.
Example: 

words.size();

1.1.2 The isEmpty() method
This method returns true if the list is empty, otherwise it returns false.

Example:
words.isEmpty();

1.1.3 The get() method
We can use this method to obtain an element in a specific index.

Example: 
words.get(2)

1.1.4 The contains() method
This method let us know if an element is in the list or not. It returns true if it is present in the list, otherwise it returns false.

Example: 
words.contains("dog");

1.1.5 The indexOf() method.
To see the position of an element in the list. If the element is not present in the list it will return a -1.

Example:
words.indexOf("cat");
words.indexOf("dog");

1.2 Immutability
The list is an immutable object in Java, which means that once we have created a list of this type we cannot add an element.

However, we can three different options. We can create an ArrayList, a LinkedList or a VectorList. Now we can add elements. 

Example: 
List<String> wordArrayList = new ArrayList<String>(words);

Likewise, we can create a LinkedList or a VectorList.
