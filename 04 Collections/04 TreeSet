There are some methods that can be used in a TreeSet that make this data structure unique and different from the HashSet and the LinkedHashSet.

Let's see the methods with an example. First we can create a TreeSet with some elements.

TreeSet <Integer> numbers = new TreeSet<>(Set.of(65, 67, 21, 11, 54, 1));

4.1 floor() method
We can use this method to see an element lower than a specific parameter. This method is inclusive.

numbers.floor(40);

4.2 lower() method
This method specifically returns an element lower than a given parameter.

numbers.lower(34);

4.3 ceiling() method
Likewise the floor() method, this method return an element greater or equal than a given number

numbers.ceiling(36);

4.4 higher() method
Similar to lower(), but with a greater element

numbers.higher(36);

4.5 subSet() method
Given two parameters, returns a subset of the TreeSet.

numbers.subSet(20,80);

4.6 headSet() method
Returns the first elements of the set until the given parameter.

numbers.headSet(50);

4.7 tailSet() method
Returns the last elements of the set until the given parameter.

numbers.tailSet(50);
